# SkyrimSE Fear mod

A plugin for SkyrimSE that aims to increase difficulty by adding fear/tension mechanics.
Affects NPCs too, but player mostly.

## Motivations

The main purpose of this project is for me to have something to apply new things on as I learn C++.
The code itself works, but that's not the point, and as such this is more a learning project than an actual SkyrimSE mod. You shouldn't use this for an actual playthrough.
